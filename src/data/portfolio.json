    "description": "Coast 2 Curb is a brand guideline project I worked on in the class Identity & Symbols. Coast 2 Curb is a movement that targets girls,  women, and queer folk  who have a passion for skateboarding and are looking for a community within it. With skateboarding being a male-dominated sport, providing a community with a bold and playful identity attached to it can help unify others for the sake of skating. These are some assets, mockups, and pages from the brand guideline book I made!\n",
